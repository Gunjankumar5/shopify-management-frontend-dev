```

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+

## Environment Setup

API configuration is controlled via a single `.env` file in the project root.

Switch between dev and prod by commenting/uncommenting:

```env
# Dev (local backend)
VITE_API_ORIGIN=http://127.0.0.1:8000

# Supabase (required for login)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-public-anon-key

# Prod (Railway backend)
# VITE_API_ORIGIN=https://shopifymanagerbackend-production-b50f.up.railway.app
```

If `VITE_API_ORIGIN` is not set, it defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Authentication

- The app now uses Supabase email/password authentication.
- When signed out, users see a dedicated login page.
- New users can sign up from the login page and confirm by email (if email confirmation is enabled in Supabase).
- After signing in, users can sign out from the sidebar.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Configure the API origin in `.env` (see above).

3. Start development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Available Scripts

| Command           | Description                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`     | Start development server         |
| `npm run build`   | Create production build          |
| `npm run preview` | Preview production build locally |
| `npm start`       | Alias for Vite dev server        |

## Notes

- This repository contains the frontend only.
- Ensure the backend is running at the origin specified in `.env`.
- If CORS errors occur, allow requests from your Vite origin on the backend.

- Dev server fails to start:
  - Run `npm install` again and retry `npm run dev`
  - Check Node.js version (`node -v`)
- API requests fail:
  - Verify backend is running on `http://localhost:8000`
  - Confirm routes exist and return valid JSON
