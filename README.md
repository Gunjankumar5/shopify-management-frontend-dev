## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ recommended
- npm 9+ recommended
- Backend API running locally

## Environment and API

The frontend currently uses this API base URL:

- `https://shopifymanagerbackend-production.up.railway.app/api`

Defined in `src/api/config.js`.

If your backend URL changes, update that file.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open the app in your browser:

- Vite usually serves at `http://localhost:5173`

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - start development server
- `npm run build` - create production build
- `npm run preview` - preview production build locally
- `npm run start` - alias for Vite dev server

## Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Notes

- This repository contains the frontend only.
- Ensure the backend routes used by pages are available under `/api`.
- If CORS errors occur, allow requests from your Vite origin (for example, `http://localhost:5173`) on the backend.

## Troubleshooting

- Dev server fails to start:
  - Run `npm install` again and retry `npm run dev`
  - Check Node.js version (`node -v`)
- API requests fail:
  - Verify backend is running on `http://localhost:8000`
  - Confirm routes exist and return valid JSON
